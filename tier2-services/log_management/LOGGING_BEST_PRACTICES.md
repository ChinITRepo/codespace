# Centralized Logging Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for implementing and managing centralized logging within the Infrastructure Automation Framework.

## Why Centralized Logging?

Centralized logging provides several key benefits:

- **Unified view** of logs across your entire infrastructure
- **Improved security** with better detection and alerting capabilities
- **Simplified troubleshooting** with all logs in one place
- **Regulatory compliance** with secure log retention requirements
- **Better operational insights** through log analysis

## Logging Architecture Tiers

### Tier 1: Log Collection

- **Use structured logging formats** whenever possible (JSON, CEF, etc.)
- **Include standard fields** in all logs (timestamp, source, severity, etc.)
- **Set appropriate log levels** to reduce noise and storage costs
- **Implement log rotation** on all source systems
- **Configure log forwarding** with reliable delivery mechanisms

### Tier 2: Log Transport and Processing

- **Secure log transmission** using TLS/SSL for all log data in transit
- **Implement buffering** to handle connectivity issues or spikes
- **Set up log parsing** for consistent data structure
- **Filter sensitive data** before centralization
- **Use efficient compression** for optimized storage and transmission

### Tier 3: Log Storage and Retention

- **Implement tiered storage** based on age and importance
- **Set appropriate retention policies** based on compliance requirements
- **Encrypt log data at rest** to protect sensitive information
- **Implement access controls** for log data
- **Create backup and DR strategies** for log archives

### Tier 4: Log Analysis and Visualization

- **Create dashboards** for operational visibility
- **Set up alerts** for anomalies and security incidents
- **Implement log correlation** to identify complex patterns
- **Use automated analysis** for large log volumes
- **Generate periodic reports** for compliance and analysis

## Structured Logging Guidelines

Structured logs should include:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| timestamp | When the event occurred | `2025-03-16T10:15:30Z` |
| service | Name of the service/component | `web-server-01` |
| level | Log level/severity | `ERROR`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` |
| message | Human-readable message | `User authentication failed` |
| correlation_id | Request/transaction ID | `req-12345-abcde` |
| user_id | User identifier (if applicable) | `user123` |
| resource | Resource being accessed | `/api/v1/users` |
| client_ip | Client IP address | `192.168.1.1` |
| duration_ms | Operation duration in milliseconds | `42` |
| status_code | HTTP or application status code | `403` |

## Security Logging Best Practices

Always log the following security events:

1. **Authentication events** (success/failure)
2. **Authorization changes** (permission grants/revokes)
3. **Resource access** (especially for sensitive resources)
4. **System configuration changes**
5. **Security control activation/deactivation**
6. **Malicious activity indicators**

## AWS-Specific Logging Recommendations

### CloudWatch Logs

- Use **log groups** to organize logs by application and environment
- Set appropriate **retention periods** based on data lifecycle
- Implement **metric filters** for important patterns
- Configure **subscription filters** to process and forward logs
- Use **CloudWatch Logs Insights** for ad-hoc analysis

### S3 Log Archives

- Enable **bucket versioning** for immutable log records
- Set up **lifecycle policies** for cost-effective storage
- Implement **server-side encryption** (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- Configure **access logging** on log buckets
- Use **S3 Object Lock** for compliance requirements

### Security Services Integration

- Forward security-relevant logs to **AWS Security Hub**
- Configure **GuardDuty** for threat detection
- Set up **AWS Config** for configuration monitoring
- Implement **CloudTrail** for API activity logging
- Use **IAM Access Analyzer** for permissions insights

## Log Management Procedures

### Incident Response

1. **Identify** the incident through log alerts or analysis
2. **Preserve** relevant logs for investigation
3. **Analyze** logs to determine scope and impact
4. **Remediate** the issue based on findings
5. **Document** the incident and response actions
6. **Improve** logging based on lessons learned

### Compliance Auditing

1. **Identify** compliance requirements for logging
2. **Configure** logging to capture required events
3. **Verify** log completeness and accuracy
4. **Generate** compliance reports from log data
5. **Preserve** logs for required retention periods
6. **Provide** secure access for auditors

## Log Volume Management

To manage log volume and costs:

- **Sample high-volume logs** where appropriate
- **Filter debug logs** in production environments
- **Aggregate similar events** to reduce redundancy
- **Use metric-based monitoring** instead of full logging for high-frequency events
- **Implement intelligent log routing** based on importance
